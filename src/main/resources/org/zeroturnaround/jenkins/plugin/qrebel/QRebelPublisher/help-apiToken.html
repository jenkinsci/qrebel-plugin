    Every project has a unique API token for authentification. This token is required in order to make issue queries to the QRebel API. Please navigate to your QRebel dashboard,
    pick the project from the left-hand side top menu as an administrator. Then go to settings and enable API functionality for the chosen project. Simple copy the generated token
    here.
